Spotify UI

At empathy.co, we strive to deliver the best search experiences to our customers. As a Frontend Engineer, you are expected to lead the way by combining your creativity and technical skills. The goal of this exercise is to get an understanding of how you apply those skills to one of our most common
challenges: crafting a search interface.

## Instructions

We'd like you to build a web application to search for artists, albums and tracks in Spotify. There are no requirements in terms of features, just pick the ones that motivate you the most! To fetch all necessary information, you can use the Spotify Web API.

## Technologies

In order to evaluate your component-oriented development skills, we’d like you to use Vue to build the UI. Besides Vue, we'd like you to pick technologies that help us get clear signal on your frontend fundamentals. For that reason, we recommend that you stick with ES6 and vanilla CSS. CSS frameworks and libraries such as Bootstrap are NOT allowed.

## Submission

We'd like to see your incremental work along with finished product, so please either ZIP and submit your version-controlled directory, or link us to your hosted repository.

## Grading

We'll be evaluating on five areas:
• Design and UX
• Performance
• Code structure
• Usage of standards
• Accessibility
